This script is provided as-is, with no support and no guarantee of proper or
desirable functioning.

This script will compress the standard output of 10x Supernova, potentially saving
significant amounts of space. Based on (very limited) testing, it appears that
compressing could result in as little as roughly 40% the disk usage of the full
output. This script can also be used to uncompress previously-compressed
Supernova output.

The user must provide the absolute or relative path to the base directory of
the Supernova output. This output directory name is set manually by the user
using the "--id" flag and this script compresses the contents of "assembly"
within this base directory. The user may also choose to adjust the compression
level, though the default of 9 (max compression) is suggested. The number of
compression cores can also be set by the user.

Note that this script relies on pigz for multi-threaded compression, though
the default number of cores to use is 1. Ensure that pigz is installed for
proper functioning. Also note that this script will not compress any additional,
non-standard Supernova output that might be present, such as that created by
the user. For example, sometimes runs will retain very large "ASSEMBLER_CS"
directories for unknown reasons that are hundreds of GB when they should be
on the order of 30-40 MB, so manually deletion/compression may be necessary.
It is recommended that the user double check the sizes of all files
and perform additional compression, where necessary. This script should not
modify any non-standard files/directories in the base directory.
