# Harvard Odyssey management scripts

A collection of scripts for managing the Harvard Odyssey cluster, including quantifying usage, identifying files that can be compressed, and more.

See the head of each script for a brief description and usage instructions.

All scripts are quite basic and can be improved in various ways, but they should be useful.
